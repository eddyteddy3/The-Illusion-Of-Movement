/*:# TRY SOMETHING NEW
The principles of motion picture photography are still valid today, although we long moved on from the early days of film production. It has never been easier to tell captivating stories with images and sound. With the iPhone in your pocket you can create [stop motion films](glossary://stopmotion) with your LEGO characters, amazing animations in 3D and augmented reality or just record life around you. And if you do so, remember where this amazing technology came from and what a revolutionary change it was in how we as humans share stories.
 

 **Maybe it can inspire you to try something new.**
